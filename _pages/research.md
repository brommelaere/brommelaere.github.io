### Carbon Flux from Wood Bioenergy Subsidies: A Structural Model of Forest Land Use  
<span style="font-weight:normal;">— <em>Job Market Paper</em> · [<a href="#" target="_blank">current draft</a>]</span>

  <summary><strong>Abstract (click to expand)</strong></summary>
Wood bioenergy offers one path to reduce carbon emissions from fossil energy and is an increasingly important fuel in both the U.K. and EU-27. Yet, because wood is more carbon intensive than fossil fuels at the smokestack, the climate impact from wood bioenergy policies depends on whether forest carbon uptake offsets these emissions. I study this question in the context of the U.S. South, a globally significant supplier of wood bioenergy. I develop a dynamic structural model of land use and harvesting decisions, extending a traditional stochastic Faustmann model to incorporate land-use switching and oligopsony power. Using this model, I assess the impact of wood bioenergy mills supplying wood to Europe following large bioenergy subsidies. The model is estimated on a panel of 5.1 million land plots, built from remote-sensing data on land use, tree harvesting, and forest biomass accumulation. My estimates imply that by 2050, harvesting rates increase by 6%, and due to imperfect replanting, forested area shrinks by ≈1,500 km² — roughly the size of Orlando’s 2010 urban footprint. By 2024, this translates to an annual decline in carbon sequestration equal to 1.3% of U.K. emissions. The resulting reduction in forest carbon stocks does not recover within any relevant policy horizon.

### Market Concentration & Deforestation: Evidence from the Brazilian Soy Industry

  <summary><strong>Abstract (click to expand)</strong></summary>
The Brazilian soy industry is a leading cause of deforestation in several major biomes, including the Amazon, yet little is known about how market structure affects land-use outcomes. This paper exploits the 2014 acquisition and merger of two major soy exporters by China’s state-owned firm COFCO to estimate the causal effects of buyer concentration on farmgate soy prices, production, and deforestation. Using a municipality-level panel from 2006–2018 linking supply-chain data, administrative data, and MapBiomas deforestation records, I implement a staggered event-study design to estimate local impacts of the merger. Results show a short-run increase in farmgate prices where buyer concentration rose — an unexpected effect consistent with strategic mutual forbearance among oligopsonists. In contrast, when COFCO enters new markets, I find that increased competition leads to sustained price increases and lower deforestation. One likely mechanism is COFCO’s deforestation-free sourcing commitments.

**Incentives and Corruption in Panama: Evidence from Gasoline Markets**  
  *with Steven Lehrer and Decio Coviello*

  <summary><strong>Abstract (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  This paper studies the misuse of public funds using transaction-level data from Panama’s national
  fuel card program, covering over two million purchases by government employees. We document both
  passive waste, arising from weak cost-minimization incentives, and active misuse, where employees
  personally benefit. We use the fuel programs rules to develop waste and misuse measures and exploit
  two distinct sources of variation in the incentives to misuse funds. A local price shock from a merger
  involving the contracted fuel supplier reduces misuse across most agencies, whereas, national fuel price
  shocks driven by exogenous oil market events increase it. We develop an economic model of expected
  profit and detection risk to explain these behavioral responses and their heterogeneity across agencies.
  Our estimates imply an elasticity of supply of stolen fuels between 2.7 and 4.6, meaning that a 10%
  rise in fuel prices increases stolen fuel by 27-46%.

### Making Transit Reliability Benefits Accessible to Engineers  
*with John Parker*, *International Conference on Transportation and Development, 2016*  
<span style="font-weight:normal;">· [<a href="https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/9780784479926.051" target="_blank">published version</a>]</span>

  <summary><strong>Abstract (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  Advances in measuring the intangible costs and benefits of transportation are being made but economic cost-benefit models used to analyze transportation infrastructure projects have not kept up. There are new benefit categories that existing transportation cost-benefit models do not include. One example is the benefit of travel time reliability. This paper summarizes the results of 30 studies of reliability and synthesizes them into a reliability ratio that can be used in transit cost-benefit analysis. By interpreting and standardizing reliability research the paper shows how cutting edge transportation research can be made available to engineering and planning professionals in their planning and design decisions. The value of reliability is implemented in a cost-benefit and risk analysis model and is freely available as a spreadsheet from the authors.
