Wood bioenergy offers one path to reduce carbon emissions from fossil energy and has become an important energy source in the U.K. and EU-27, driven largely by subsidies. At the smokestack, burning wood emits more CO<sub>2</sub> than coal, so any climate benefit depends on its impact on forest carbon flux. I study the effects of these subsidies on forests in the U.S. South, the world’s main export region of wood bioenergy, to assess whether they have delivered climate benefits. I develop a dynamic structural model which unifies land use and harvesting decisions while incorporating local oligopsony power of mills over landowners. The model is estimated on a panel of 5.1 million land plots built from remote sensing data on land use, tree harvesting, and forest biomass accumulation. The results show most exported wood comes from new harvests without offsetting increases in planting rates, leading to net deforestation, lower forest carbon stocks, and reduced annual carbon sequestration. The impact is substantial: in 2024, the estimated loss in annual sequestration equals 1.4 percent of U.K. emissions, and by 2050 the social cost of the lost forest carbon reaches $53 billion. What looked bad at the smokestack is worse once the forest response is measured. Spatial variation in the results suggests that location-based sourcing restrictions could reverse this result and deliver climate benefits.

The Brazilian soy industry is a leading cause of deforestation in several major biomes, including the Amazon, yet little is known about how market structure affects land-use outcomes. This paper exploits the 2014 acquisition and merger of two major soy exporters by China’s state-owned firm COFCO to estimate the causal effects of buyer concentration on farmgate soy prices, production, and deforestation. Using a municipality-level panel from 2006–2018 linking supply-chain data, administrative data, and MapBiomas deforestation records, I implement a staggered event-study design to estimate local impacts of the merger. Results show a short-run increase in farmgate prices where buyer concentration rose — an unexpected effect consistent with strategic mutual forbearance among oligopsonists. In contrast, when COFCO enters new markets, I find that increased competition leads to sustained price increases and lower deforestation. One likely mechanism is COFCO’s deforestation-free sourcing commitments.

  This paper studies the misuse of public funds using transaction-level data from Panama’s national
  fuel card program, covering over two million purchases by government employees. We document both
  passive waste, arising from weak cost-minimization incentives, and active misuse, where employees
  personally benefit. We use the fuel programs rules to develop waste and misuse measures and exploit
  two distinct sources of variation in the incentives to misuse funds. A local price shock from a merger
  involving the contracted fuel supplier reduces misuse across most agencies, whereas, national fuel price
  shocks driven by exogenous oil market events increase it. We develop an economic model of expected
  profit and detection risk to explain these behavioral responses and their heterogeneity across agencies.
  Our estimates imply an elasticity of supply of stolen fuels between 2.7 and 4.6, meaning that a 10%
  rise in fuel prices increases stolen fuel by 27-46%.

### Making Transit Reliability Benefits Accessible to Engineers

  Advances in measuring the intangible costs and benefits of transportation are being made but economic cost-benefit models used to analyze transportation infrastructure projects have not kept up. There are new benefit categories that existing transportation cost-benefit models do not include. One example is the benefit of travel time reliability. This paper summarizes the results of 30 studies of reliability and synthesizes them into a reliability ratio that can be used in transit cost-benefit analysis. By interpreting and standardizing reliability research the paper shows how cutting edge transportation research can be made available to engineering and planning professionals in their planning and design decisions. The value of reliability is implemented in a cost-benefit and risk analysis model and is freely available as a spreadsheet from the authors.
