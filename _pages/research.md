Wood bioenergy offers one path to reduce carbon emissions from fossil energy and is an increasingly important fuel in both the U.K. and EU-27. Yet, because wood is more carbon intensive than fossil fuels at the smokestack, the climate impact from wood bioenergy policies depends on whether forest carbon uptake offsets these emissions. I study this question in the context of the U.S. South, a globally significant supplier of wood bioenergy. I develop a dynamic structural model of land use and harvesting decisions, extending a traditional stochastic Faustmann model to incorporate land-use switching and oligopsony power. Using this model, I assess the impact of wood bioenergy mills supplying wood to Europe following large bioenergy subsidies. The model is estimated on a panel of 5.1 million land plots, built from remote-sensing data on land use, tree harvesting, and forest biomass accumulation. My estimates imply that by 2050, harvesting rates increase by 6%, and due to imperfect replanting, forested area shrinks by ≈1,500 km² — roughly the size of Orlando’s 2010 urban footprint. By 2024, this translates to an annual decline in carbon sequestration equal to 1.3% of U.K. emissions. The resulting reduction in forest carbon stocks does not recover within any relevant policy horizon.

### [Market Concentration & Deforestation: Evidence from the Brazilian Soy Industry](#) <span style="font-weight:normal;">· [<a href="#" target="_blank">current draft</a>]</span>

  <summary><strong>Abstract (click to expand)</strong></summary>

The Brazilian soy industry is a leading cause of deforestation in several major biomes, including the Amazon, yet little is known about how market structure affects land-use outcomes. This paper exploits the 2014 acquisition and merger of two major soy exporters by China’s state-owned firm COFCO to estimate the causal effects of buyer concentration on farmgate soy prices, production, and deforestation. Using a municipality-level panel from 2006–2018 linking supply-chain data, administrative data, and MapBiomas deforestation records, I implement a staggered event-study design to estimate local impacts of the merger. Results show a short-run increase in farmgate prices where buyer concentration rose — an unexpected effect consistent with strategic mutual forbearance among oligopsonists. In contrast, when COFCO enters new markets, I find that increased competition leads to sustained price increases and lower deforestation. One likely mechanism is COFCO’s deforestation-free sourcing commitments.
