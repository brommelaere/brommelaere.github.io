Wood bioenergy offers one path to reduce carbon emissions from fossil energy and is an increasingly important fuel in both the U.K. and EU-27. Yet, because wood is more carbon intensive than fossil fuels at the smokestack, the climate impact from wood bioenergy policies depends on whether forest carbon uptake offsets these emissions. I study this question in the context of the U.S. South, a globally significant supplier of wood bioenergy. I develop a dynamic structural model of land use and harvesting decisions, extending a traditional stochastic Faustmann model to incorporate land-use switching and oligopsony power. Using this model, I assess the impact of wood bioenergy mills supplying wood to Europe following large bioenergy subsidies. The model is estimated on a panel of 5.1 million land plots, built from remote-sensing data on land use, tree harvesting, and forest biomass accumulation. My estimates imply that by 2050, harvesting rates increase by 6%, and due to imperfect replanting, forested area shrinks by ≈1,500 km² — roughly the size of Orlando’s 2010 urban footprint. By 2024, this translates to an annual decline in carbon sequestration equal to 1.3% of U.K. emissions. The resulting reduction in forest carbon stocks does not recover within any relevant policy horizon.

### Market Concentration & Deforestation: Evidence from the Brazilian Soy Industry

  <summary><strong>Abstract (click to expand)</strong></summary>

The Brazilian soy industry is a leading cause of deforestation in several major biomes, including the Amazon, yet little is known about how market structure affects land-use outcomes. This paper exploits the 2014 acquisition and merger of two major soy exporters by China’s state-owned firm COFCO to estimate the causal effects of buyer concentration on farmgate soy prices, production, and deforestation. Using a municipality-level panel from 2006–2018 linking supply-chain data, administrative data, and MapBiomas deforestation records, I implement a staggered event-study design to estimate local impacts of the merger. Results show a short-run increase in farmgate prices where buyer concentration rose — an unexpected effect consistent with strategic mutual forbearance among oligopsonists. In contrast, when COFCO enters new markets, I find that increased competition leads to sustained price increases and lower deforestation. One likely mechanism is COFCO’s deforestation-free sourcing commitments.

  <summary><strong>Abstract (click to expand)</strong></summary>

  This paper studies the misuse of public funds using transaction-level data from Panama’s national
  fuel card program, covering over two million purchases by government employees. We document both
  passive waste, arising from weak cost-minimization incentives, and active misuse, where employees
  personally benefit. We use the fuel programs rules to develop waste and misuse measures and exploit
  two distinct sources of variation in the incentives to misuse funds. A local price shock from a merger
  involving the contracted fuel supplier reduces misuse across most agencies, whereas, national fuel price
  shocks driven by exogenous oil market events increase it. We develop an economic model of expected
  profit and detection risk to explain these behavioral responses and their heterogeneity across agencies.
  Our estimates imply an elasticity of supply of stolen fuels between 2.7 and 4.6, meaning that a 10%
  rise in fuel prices increases stolen fuel by 27-46%.
