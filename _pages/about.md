I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Toronto. My research uses tools from empirical industrial organization and applied microeconomics to study environmental regulation.

My job market paper develops a dynamic structural model of forest harvesting and land use to quantify the carbon effects of EU wood-bioenergy subsidies. More broadly, my research examines how environmental regulation shapes market structure and land-use outcomes to inform better environmental policy design.

I will be on the job market in 2025â€“2026.
